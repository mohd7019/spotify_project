## ðŸ“ˆ Business & Analytical Questions Solved

### ðŸŽ¯ Easy Level:
- Total streams, unique artists, unique albums.
- Tracks with more than 1 billion streams.
- Total comments on licensed tracks.
- List of singles and albums.
- Total tracks per artist.

### ðŸŽ¯ Medium Level:
- Average danceability per album.
- Top 5 highest energy tracks.
- Total views/likes of official videos.
- Track-level comparison between YouTube vs. Spotify streams.
- Album-wise total views.

### ðŸŽ¯ Advanced Level:
- **Top 3 most-viewed tracks per artist (Window Function).**
- Tracks with liveness above average.
- Energy difference across albums using `WITH` clause.
- Songs with energy-to-liveness ratio > 1.2.
- Cumulative likes ordered by views.
- Analysis: Do high-energy songs perform better than low-energy ones?

## ðŸ›  SQL Techniques Used

- `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `MAX()`, `AVG()`, `ROUND()`
- `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`, `HAVING`
- `CASE` statements for classification
- `COALESCE()` and `NULLIF()` handling
- String functions: `LIKE`, `%`, `ILIKE`
- **Window Functions:** `DENSE_RANK()`, `SUM() OVER()`
- **CTEs (Common Table Expressions):** using `WITH`
- Subqueries and derived tables

## ðŸ“Š Sample Query Insight

**Top 3 Most Viewed Tracks Per Artist (Window Function Example):**

```sql
WITH ranking_artist AS (
    SELECT
        artist,
        track,
        SUM(views) AS total_view,
        DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY artist ORDER BY SUM(views) DESC) AS rank
    FROM spotify
    GROUP BY artist, track
)
SELECT *
FROM ranking_artist
WHERE rank <= 3;
